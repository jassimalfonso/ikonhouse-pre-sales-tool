# Changelog

All notable changes to the ikonhouse AV Pre-Sales Tool.
Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com); versioning
follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org).

## [1.1.0] — 2026-07-12

### Added
- **Undo for crop and rotate.** Both operations now snapshot the plan first;
  `Ctrl+Z` / `Cmd+Z` restores the image, dimensions and every ikon exactly
  as they were. Previously a crop was irreversible.
- **Undo button in the toolbar** (↩) so tablet and phone users can undo
  without a keyboard. Works for ikon add/remove as well as crop/rotate.
- **Tablet crop gestures:** while cropping, a one-finger drag inside the
  frame slides the floor plan beneath a visually steady crop window
  (photo-cropper style), and a two-finger pinch zooms the plan under the
  frame — the crop region rescales inversely so the window appears fixed.
  Mouse behaviour is unchanged (dragging the frame moves the frame).

### Changed
- Crop corner handles are roughly twice as large on touch devices
  (`pointer: coarse`), making them far easier to grab on tablets.

### Compatibility
- `.ikonplan` files from 1.0.0 open unchanged.
